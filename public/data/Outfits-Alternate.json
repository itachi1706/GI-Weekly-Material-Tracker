      "lore": "In the last three months, Amber has had a bone or three to pick with Wolfhooks. While out scouting, her uniform and stockings were torn by their sharp hooks, and unfortunately, her schedule was such that there was no time to get them fixed.\nThe Knights' logistics division gave her 3 sets of uniform of the same type initially, so wearing one out was not exactly a major emergency. But Amber loved those three sets quite dearly, and would have been quite upset regardless of which one was torn.\nEven Baron Bunny had his design based on these uniforms — Amber recalled, with a twinge of sadness.\n\nSo when her mission ended, Amber would attempt to sew the damaged uniform back together, but despite her excellent skills, the marks of her needlework remained stitched into the fabric.\nHowever, Amber would obtain a new uniform not half a month at the Knights' end-of-year meeting.\nIt was a fair bit more official, the craft was more ornate... And it was also stated to be more hook-proof than the previous version.\n\"On behalf of the Knights of Favonius, I'd like to present you, our one and only Outrider, with some new clothes! Thanks for all you've done for us so far\". So Hertha, their logistics captain, had said.",

As you approached, a sudden urge to prank her came over you... But even as you crept up, angling to clap her on the shoulder, she stopped singing.\n\"If you were trying to scare me, I'm afraid you're too late.\"\n\nAh, as one might have expected from Mona Megistus, the Astrologist. Your attempt failed, you could only sit beside her. Clearing her throat, Mona began to speak in a professorial tone—\n\"The stars are truly lovely today, making this a fine night to watch the sky. And now that I've convinced the couple who are usually here to leave, this is now the perfect spot to conduct our class on the 'Basics of Astrology.'\"\nHuh. So that's why you hadn't seen Marvin or Marla.\n\"Then let's begin.\"\n\"'Astrology' is an umbrella term for the study of the laws that govern the movements of matter. The celestial bodies are but a shallow subject of research in this regard...\"\nYou understood the basic preamble just fine, but as she continued to speak, the topic grew more complicated, and you started to lose the plot. Still, she spoke so enthusiastically about the subject that you could not bring yourself to interrupt.\nLooking at her bright gray eyes and her constant gesticulations, you couldn't help but feel some embarrassment... Wait a moment.\n\"Did you change your clothes?\"\nSeeming to not expect your question, she seemed a little put on the spot at first, though she recovered quickly.\n\"That's right. I'm wearing these new clothes just to commemorate this momentous occasion as your astrology teacher. You can take this as a sign of... uh, respect\".\nFeeling a little guilty, you told yourself to get serious. Slapping the sagging, sleeping cheeks of yours, you forced your eyes open and continued listening to her lecture.\n\"The laws of matter are actually very simple. Rather, it is the principles that govern humanity that are the most complex. As such, we astrologists...\"\nAll the while, you thought to yourself, don't fall asleep, don't fall asleep, don't... Zzz...\n\"Heh. What am I going to do with you...\" Your astrology master mutters.",
