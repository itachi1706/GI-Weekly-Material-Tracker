      "lore": "In the eyes of ordinary people, just as flowers differ in quality due to the nature of their growth, so too do academic achievements differ in worth.\nCertain researchers of exemplary capabilities are compared to \"Padisarahs,\" while those with more common accomplishments are regarded as akin to the more widely seen \"Mints.\"\nAs time passed, some students also found themselves influenced by these analogies. Thus, they began to use different species of flowers as amusing nicknames for each other.\nIt was unanimously agreed that the Akademiya was full of \"Sweet Flowers\" and \"Mints,\" but \"Roses\" and \"Padisarahs\" were individuals of vanishing quality.\nThus, it was baffling to many that the genius Lisa Minci possessed all the qualities of a \"Padisarah\" but cared little even to claim the title of \"Rose.\"\nAs an academic, she finished a great many projects left incomplete by those who came before her, and also possessed a solid grasp of theory.\nHer accomplishments earned her the regard of her instructors, and soon she was allowed to study even the most complex of topics. In little time, she began contributing to the advancement of her new studies as well.\nAt that time, certain researchers even thought that she could become the youngest sage in history — provided she made a few adjustments to her field of study, of course.\nYet, she didn't participate in the official signing ceremony that would certify her academic accomplishments, choosing instead to withdraw from the main project she was studying in her Darshan, before leaving the Akademiya altogether.\nWhen faced with the confusion radiating from her classmates' questions, she merely replied as elegantly and affably as she always did:\n\"My work can be compared to rearranging a mess of books and putting them all back in their rightful place, that's all. With that in mind, it's unnecessary for me to claim something so serious as an official title.\"\n\"Also, do you remember that song that was so popular amongst us students?\"\n\"'We beg not for the Kalpalata Lotus' mystery, we struggle not to claim the Padisarah's purity.'\"\n\"'For with poetry by our sides, their fragrance ever lingers in our lives.'\"\n\"In times past, the rose was a flower precious without peer. But after generations of scholars worked tirelessly to cultivate them, roses can now be found wherever the sunlight shines.\"\n\"But is this bad for the roses? Well, of course not. Rare or common, the roses remain as fragrant as ever. Their preciousness was but a label we gave them.\"\n\"As such, if there comes a day when everyone ceases to regard these flowers so subjectively and instead judges them with consideration to their growth habits and choice of environments... That day's coming, I think, might be something worthier of commemoration.\"",

The primary color is that of luxurious cream, embroidered with intricate patterns.\nThe dark brown of the hat, gloves, and skirts have a rich chocolate-like texture. The fiery red that belongs only to Klee is like a crown of candles, shining with flame incandescent.\nThe tiny little Spark Knight, after an adventure in which even the clouds and trees could not help but dote upon her, has transformed with a flourish into the new \"Red Velvet Mage.\"\n\n\"To a mage, what is the most important thing?\"\nAfter returning to Mondstadt, two knights, one large and one small, are sitting on the city wall, watching the windmills lazily turn as they chat...\nThough Klee had heard the title \"mage\" before, but after hearing the stories of that fiery mage, the word slowly gained its own special significance to her.\nShe remembered that adults often spoke of important things linked to one's identity... perhaps they are called \"responsibilities\"?\nThe Dagger Bandit grinned mysteriously, and shook the wine bottle in his hand:\n\"A mage is called a mage because they can use that mystifying force called magic.\"\n\"The most important thing for a mage is to think about how to use the awesome power of their magic.\"\n\"The fiery red mage from all those years ago used her magic to fulfill the wishes of others, and created this refreshing paradise in the desert. The people sing her praises, and write her into their happiest stories, and she is a source of happiness and laughter.\"\n\"Perhaps, somewhere in the world, there are capricious mages with fearful tempers, or those who have been changed by terrible tragedy. Those mages may use their magic in the wrong ways, and make the people as angry and sad as they are...\"\n\"Red Velvet Mage Klee, how do you plan to use your magic?\"\nWith these words, the Dagger Bandit raised his glass to softly toast the tiny mage, indicating it was now her turn to answer her own question.\nThe Red Velvet Mage shook her head softly, and the juice in her cup reflected her pure smile:\n\"Klee... wants to make everyone really happy!\"\nBut with these words, the mage suddenly realized the problem with this desire—\nThose who are unhappy surely have their reasons for being sad. Would a smile forced upon their lips through magic be even more painful and ugly than tears?\nFortunately, her little mind worked quickly, and she soon found her answer:\nThen I'll use my magic to get rid of everyone's troubles!\n\"For example, magic could make everyone never get sick again, and never have to worry about Mora! Everyone could eat fish for every meal, and be healthy, and just happily play all day!\"\nBut that didn't seem like enough. Klee rested her cheek in her hand, and looked out over the azure sky and white clouds in the distance:\n\"I want... I want to hear everyone's wishes, and save them, and then use the most amazing and powerful magic, to give everyone the happiness they want the very very most!\"\nA smile is most beautiful when it is born of happiness. The reflective waters of Cider Lake taught Klee this truth.\nThe Dagger Bandit was stunned for a moment, but as the west wind caressed them, it turned into a feeling of peace and relief:\n\"In that case, our little Klee is going to have to try her best, isn't she? Perhaps some day, you and your magic will appear in the happiest and most joyous of all stories.\"\nIn the story, the Red Velvet Mage travels to every corner of Teyvat with her companions. Wherever they go, both troubles and bad guys recede, and poverty and suffering evaporate without a trace. Clusters of sweet flowers bloom, and are surrounded by the light of a roaring campfire, candles, and stars. The sounds of joyous song and jubilant dancing fill the air, a merry feast that never ends.",

The story behind it is also rather fascinating—\nSince her first day as the Yuheng, she has never enjoyed its privileges but has instead devoted much private time to her duty. To improve work efficiency, Keqing prefers a dressing style that prioritizes practicality and only keeps a minimum level of embellishment. Therefore, though like a flower she blooms, she used to dress simple.\nHowever, working closely with Ganyu and then Ningguang has given Keqing a sort of epiphany—\nKeqing accepts that she cannot work day and night like the half-adeptal secretary Ganyu. She also knows Ningguang's way well, who often takes a bath after work to withdraw from the moment. By temporarily putting the crazy agenda aside for the next day, Ningguang thus allows herself to fully relax.\nKeqing understands that to lead the tide of change requires not impatient leaps and bounds but care for one's body and mind. Good maintenance keeps one going smoothly.\nNingguang also gave Keqing similar advice:\n\"You've never donned anything special for festivals, and people are used to your image as it is. But Liyue is different now. If you show up in front of the public in a new look, it will add to the merrymaking and inspire everyone greatly.\"\nKeqing was aware of that, but she just wanted to transform silently so that she wouldn't worry her colleagues.\nHer attire for the Lantern Rite would serve as a good start.\n\"This attire marks the line between my work and life. By striking a balance between the two, I will find a comfortable pace at which I shall lead the way into a new Liyue.\"\nHaving made up her mind, Keqing had Ningguang's personal tailor make her a dress that still keeps luxury to a minimum. With the attire finished, Keqing threw herself back into the preparations for the Lantern Rite.\nAs for how she ended up overworking herself again, accidents like that do happen, occasionally.\nWhile conversing with the Traveler again in the Jade Chamber, their caring advice reminded Keqing of the decision she had made not long ago. A faint smile formed on her face.\nPerhaps this is what they call the tacit understanding between ideal companions, who are always on the same page.\nShe put on the long-readied attire and spoke gently to the Traveler, who looked her way. Having received generous praises, she turned to the blooming fireworks.\nThe light of festive fireworks set her dress aglow like a star in a dark night. The hem of her dress danced at her steps like flowers flowing in a gentle breeze.",

Even one such as Ningguang could nary bear the loss.\nEven after the dust had settled and the opportunity to rebuild the Chamber came, she still spent much time in troubled consideration.\nMany things happen in this world — who could say when great loss might loom?\nEach time she thought on this, she would feel depressed.\n\nAs the banquet in the skies began anew, Ningguang stepped forward in her indigo dress to invite the gathered guests to celebrate with her.\nYet amid the revelry, amidst the sea of famous relics, precious trinkets, fine cuisine, and the cries of joy and laughter,\nLiyue's Tianquan was once again gripped by melancholy.\n\nLeaving her seat, she stood under the night sky with a clouded heart.\nThe sounds of cheer within the pavilion could no longer be heard from this far away — it was as if she were alone under the stars.\nAs she often would in past, she gazed down at Liyue beneath her feet—\nThe faint moonlight seemed to be cast about Liyue's face like a veil. From Bishui Plain to Lisha, the land was painted a magnificent, gentle white.\nThis was a sight that Ningguang was most familiar with. Ever since the Jade Chamber was completed, she would gaze upon this majestic view every night.\nTime flies, but the mountains and seas remain.\n\n\"The mortal world is fleeting, but there are things that will not change so easily.\"\n\"A hundred years from now, perhaps, all things might be different. But then, my beauty would have faded, my body reduced to withered bones.\"\n\"This garment, too, will by then have grown dull, no matter how opulent it may have been in its prime.\"\n\"But so long as I live, riches uncounted shall be at my disposal, as shall the Tianquan's authority, so vested in me.\"\n\"I will live this life to the full — lacking not at all for power, wealth, or friends.\"\n\"Was this not what I resolved to do from the beginning? If so, then how could I simply allow myself to fall into this pit — to lose my wits because of a moment's emptiness?\"\n\"Life must be treasured precisely because it is fleeting.\"\n\"But a thousand, even ten thousand years from now, those who come after will remember this name — Ningguang.\"\n\nAs she returned to the feast, her heart was clear.\nAnd when she emerged before the crowd again, the Tianquan Ningguang wore that calm, self-assured smile once more.",

Not only would he bring dawn to Mondstadt as a member of the Ragnvindr Clan, but he would also become an excellent Knight of Favonius, standing at the apex of the crowd, inheriting and passing its noble traditions down.\nThis expectation would bleed into their conversations, into training, and into every little detail of life, with the proud father even having a ceremonial uniform tailored for Diluc well in advance.\nYet, for Diluc, his father's praises and his life as a knight were extinguished forever on that gloomy, rainy night, and the ceremonial garment thus lost its purpose.\nMany years later, the tragedy and the uproar had finally stabilized. Returning home, Diluc began his journey of \"reckoning.\"\nThis was not merely for his father's sake, but also on account of the convictions he had suffered much to gain. He would protect Mondstadt in his own way.\nThe ceremonial uniform of yesteryear was modified to serve as new cladding for battle.

And wherever the blade passed, wherever the claymore's arc flashed, raging flames would arise and burn the hidden nests of villainy to the ground.\nBy the time the name of the Darknight Hero had become well known to the people of Mondstadt, the red so striking that it might sear the eyes had long become a thing of awe and terror to monsters and crooks alike.\n\"The true dawn has yet to come.\"\nContrary to his father's expectations, Diluc knew that he must instead be a \"forerunner.\"",

Many days have already passed since they played the roles of bandit and mage on the stage, and even now, the small knight has questions about that which she does not yet understand.\n\n*Ahem* The reason the bandits carries daggers… The reason was never explained in Kaeya’s script. Perhaps it’s because the character needed a catchy name, and the director just excitedly scrawled the words, \"the Dagger Bandit.\" But the small knight in front of him sat with furrowed brow, deep in thought, more serious even than when thinking about what was for dinner.\n\nThe boundless curiosity of children makes them always want to ask questions. Even if the endless stream of questions can be a bit annoying for adults, if their curiosity is not satisfied, they may lose that spark of curiosity, and turn into a boring adult. Of all the infinite possibilities in life, becoming boring is one of the worst and most tragic outcomes, so a child’s questions should always be treated with care.\n\n\"Hey, that’s right, why is that? You asked a great question, Klee…\" Kaeya replied with a smile.\n\nPerhaps because he was briefly a bandit on that stage, he too had thought about lives lived that were not his own beneath the bright lights. Knights live as knights do, and bandits live as bandits must. Justly taking up sword and bow and standing forth to show their determination to protect, that is a knight. But hiding one’s blade and closing the net on their prey in the darkness, that is a bandit. Different people live in different ways. A thief will not bear the blade of a knight, and a traditional knight will not sneak out a hidden dagger to hurt someone.\n\nIf the characters in the story don’t abide by such rules, then the story has betrayed the roles dictated by fate. But there is no need to give such answers to a child, and there is never just one answer to a question. The daggers used by the Dagger Bandit were gifts from his friends, or symbols of his career as a virtuous bandit, or commemorated past acts of charity…\n\nLet’s fabricate a fairytale, and weave heroes, legends, and beautiful fantasies together, just like each time before, and give children a dream to dream. He turns around and takes the dagger from the side of the costume hanging in the room:\n\n\"It’s actually a complicated tale, and we’ll have to start from when the big bandit was just a little kid. Would you like to hear about it, Klee?\"\n\n\"Are you going to tell me another story, Kaeya? I’m listening!\"",

After all, who has never hankered after the blissful beauty of luxury?\n\nBut now, Jean has had her wish granted with a set of form-fitting summer wear made just for her — and this one item has far surpassed any number of beauteous dresses that appeared in her novels.\n\"I heard that the original idea was Barbara's and that she and Lisa searched every store before deciding on the most suitable design.\"\n\"Then Kaeya was somehow able to convince Master Diluc to hire craftsmen to make some modifications...\"\n\"...With fabric chosen by Amber out of her experience with making Baron Bunnies, to render it comfortable but relatively inexpensive...\"\n\"...And with gems for decoration picked from Albedo and Klee's collections.\"\n\"The tailoring was then overseen by Noelle, right down to the last needle and thread...\"\n\"...And the detailed dimensions were provided by Lisa, who even sewed this lovely rose ornament on personally...\"\nThis gift, made for her by everyone, was the loveliest surprise she had ever had.\n\nIf her previous holiday was a tiny respite amidst a sea of work, this seaside trip was an unexpected opportunity to fully relax.\nHaving laid her armor aside, she now shimmered in the sea's light like a twirling dandelion.\n\"This... is the first time I've ever had such a relaxing summer holiday.\"",

      "lore": "At the foot of the Sacred Sakura Tree, a lovely brocade mat lined the ground, an exquisite and beautifully-arranged meal awaiting atop it.\nSuch was the view that met your eyes when you followed the invitation letter's instructions guiding you to what it called a \"picnic.\"\nMoments after, Kamisato Ayaka, the organizer of this picnic, emerged from behind the tree, smiling with a fan in hand and unhurried of gait.\n\"I've heard that the people of Fontaine enjoy having picnics. I, too, wish to indulge in one such event. Perhaps I'll be able to sample the experience this novel writes of.\"\nThat was to be expected: the Yae Publishing House's newly published Fontaine light novel, \"The Case Files of Miss Orith,\" had taken Inazuma by storm of late, after all.\nAyaka had been reading this novel too. From time to time, the two of you would meet and discuss the methods of deduction used within the novel, revealing her deep appreciation for the entire series.\n\nWith her hair coiled up and wearing an elegant lady's hat, she looked just like the Fontaine beauty described in the novel.\nYou found the transformation amazing — though the figure before you was obviously still Ayaka, she had achieved a new sort of elegance merely by changing her apparel.\nThe \"Dame of Fontaine\" before you said:\n\"While reading 'The Case Files of Miss Orith,' I often feel that though there might be similarities between the cultural habits of individual nations...\"\n\"The private lives of each nation's peoples remain more different than not.\"\n\"To appraise the lifestyle of a world beyond Inazuma is like peering at the moon's face through a veil of clouds...\"\n\nShe lowered her head, seemingly vexed.\nAs the daughter of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Ayaka is unable to live with the freedom comparable to that of an adventurer — this, you knew quite well.\nJust as you were about to say something to console her, she nodded, as if experiencing an epiphany, and said:\n\"Though such is reality, I am already vastly more fortunate than most.\"\n\"With a friend like you, even though I cannot travel, the stories I have heard are no longer limited to Inazuma's borders.\"\n\"...I wish that everyone — not just me — could know more about what lies beyond our shores.\"\nSo, Ayaka hadn't been distressed on her own account, it seemed.\n\"Miss Aratani once told me that, beyond the bounds of Inazuma, learning and art flourishes in Sumeru, Mondstadt, Liyue, and Fontaine.\"\n\"Yet, we know so very little of them...\"\n\"I intend to propose to my brother and Lady Yae that we bring in more pieces of work from outside Inazuma!\"\n\"Perhaps we can get a glimpse of places and peoples we've never witnessed before by using their literary works as windows...\"\nAyaka's bearing far exceeded your expectations — this was, indeed, the \"Shirasagi Himegimi\" of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan.\n\"...Before I can propose this to my brother and Lady Yae, however, I must create a specific list of books to be published. As such, I wanted to ask you for some recommendations.\"\nBefore you realized it, moved as you were by her words, Ayaka had already begun touching upon the particulars of her plan.\nAfter a moment of deep reflection, you put words to paper and fill the first line of the list in.\n\"'The Boar Princess'?\"\n\"Indeed,\" you reply. \"It's a beautiful and cruel fairy tale — rather different from other works of its kind. I think people will find it very interesting.\"\nUnfortunately, when Ayaka brought the list of books to Aratani, the editor crossed out \"The Boar Princess\" without hesitation.\n\"Ahem. This fairy tale might be a bit too... unique. I fear that people might not be ready for its contents yet...\"",

Yes! So it was decided.\n\nBut a seaside trip requires preparation.\nSnacks, sweets... ah yes, and Spicy Dried Fish, too. All this, she placed into her cute yellow ducky bag. ♪\nOh, and let's not forget clothes! I'll need some light and comfy swimwear. This short skirt looks good — and those little white flowers lend a playful look to those shoes! ♪\nAnd perhaps a little bow tied around the neckline, would that look cuter?\nBarbara began to hum happily to herself: La~ la la la la~ la la! ♪\n\nBut there was no way her sister would have time to prepare any swimwear for herself, would she?\nThat was quite the pickle... Still, there were ways around that.\nBarbara pushed the door of the library open with a smile. \"Do you have time, Miss Lisa? I'd like your help with picking a set of clothes.\"",
