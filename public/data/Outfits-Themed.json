      "lore": "In the eyes of ordinary people, just as flowers differ in quality due to the nature of their growth, so too do academic achievements differ in worth.\nCertain researchers of exemplary capabilities are compared to \"Padisarahs,\" while those with more common accomplishments are regarded as akin to the more widely seen \"Mints.\"\nAs time passed, some students also found themselves influenced by these analogies. Thus, they began to use different species of flowers as amusing nicknames for each other.\nIt was unanimously agreed that the Akademiya was full of \"Sweet Flowers\" and \"Mints,\" but \"Roses\" and \"Padisarahs\" were individuals of vanishing quality.\nThus, it was baffling to many that the genius Lisa Minci possessed all the qualities of a \"Padisarah\" but cared little even to claim the title of \"Rose.\"\nAs an academic, she finished a great many projects left incomplete by those who came before her, and also possessed a solid grasp of theory.\nHer accomplishments earned her the regard of her instructors, and soon she was allowed to study even the most complex of topics. In little time, she began contributing to the advancement of her new studies as well.\nAt that time, certain researchers even thought that she could become the youngest sage in history — provided she made a few adjustments to her field of study, of course.\nYet, she didn't participate in the official signing ceremony that would certify her academic accomplishments, choosing instead to withdraw from the main project she was studying in her Darshan, before leaving the Akademiya altogether.\nWhen faced with the confusion radiating from her classmates' questions, she merely replied as elegantly and affably as she always did:\n\"My work can be compared to rearranging a mess of books and putting them all back in their rightful place, that's all. With that in mind, it's unnecessary for me to claim something so serious as an official title.\"\n\"Also, do you remember that song that was so popular amongst us students?\"\n\"'We beg not for the Kalpalata Lotus' mystery, we struggle not to claim the Padisarah's purity.'\"\n\"'For with poetry by our sides, their fragrance ever lingers in our lives.'\"\n\"In times past, the rose was a flower precious without peer. But after generations of scholars worked tirelessly to cultivate them, roses can now be found wherever the sunlight shines.\"\n\"But is this bad for the roses? Well, of course not. Rare or common, the roses remain as fragrant as ever. Their preciousness was but a label we gave them.\"\n\"As such, if there comes a day when everyone ceases to regard these flowers so subjectively and instead judges them with consideration to their growth habits and choice of environments... That day's coming, I think, might be something worthier of commemoration.\"",

      "lore": "\"What? Meowndering Hero's gone missing!? At this juncture, of all times!?\"\nThe troupe leader's furious voice echoed backstage.\n\"And right when Feiyun Commerce Guild's having important guests from Fontaine over for an evening banquet? Come on! If we run our reputation into the ground here, it's is going to be disaster for our shows on both shores of the sea!\"\nThe actor playing the \"wandering hero,\" head shrunken back in a panic, looked nothing like the part.\n\"Th—There's still time before we take the stage. I'll go look for it right now!\"\n\nOutside the backstage window, sitting leisurely on a corner eave, was Xingqiu.\n\"I see, I see. So it is a matter of saving face, then, that no one from our Guild was asked to join the search? That complicates things... How, then, am I to tell them that you're here, Mr. Cat?\"\nStanding up, Xingqiu peeped down the chimney mouth next to him — within, a black cat in swashbuckling garb stared up at him, eyes vigilant.\nTo say nothing of his own chicanery in secreting himself away from the banquet making him ill-suited to meet others directly, someone known as the \"second young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild\" finding this 'Meowndering Hero' would make things terribly awkward for the opera troupe.\n\"I guess I'll just have to rescue you and take you backstage in secret, huh... Ugh, I hope I don't get these clothes dirty, or my brother's going to ask some pointed questions about where I've been again...\"\nXingqiu reached cautiously into the chimney, but the cat ducked into a corner, rejecting his proffered helping hand.\n\"Spooked by the unfamiliar environment? Or are you just not fond of the banquet atmosphere? Either way, Mr. Cat, getting others in hot water is not quite what a cat with your title should be doing.\"\nHe grinned wryly. No getting this kitty to come along without getting his hands dirty, huh?\n\nThe night went as planned, and the troupe took the stage without a hitch.\nMeowndering Hero twirled and flipped to the strict rhythm of the gong, seemingly endless applause breaking out.\n\"Amazing! Most amazing!\" Xingqiu exclaimed while grabbing onto his older brother. What grabbed said brother's attention, however, was Xingqiu's new attire.\nThis Fontainian-style ensemble's well-tailored lines were adorned with elegant bamboo patterns. Clearly, the work of a master...\nAnd yet, when he had first received it, had this little lad not complained that it \"restricted movement\" and \"made it hard to conceal oneself,\" wearing it but once before folding it up and putting it back on the shelf? Where was this sudden love for it coming from?\nAs if reading the doubt written on his brother's face, Xingqiu smiled softly, saying: \"I came across this line while reading last night: 'One should make guests feel at home'... Changing into these clothes to welcome guests from Fontaine is a form of courtesy too, is it not?\"\nThe doubt knitted into the elder brother's brows dissipated, and he looked Xingqiu up and down once more. His clothes were quite clean, so he certainly didn't seem to have snuck out like he had last year...\nPerhaps his kid brother really had matured a little this year, he thought with some relief.\n...Still, there was a faint smell of ash in the air. Where was that coming from, exactly?\n\n\"No need to trouble yourselves. I'll change by myself.\"\nWhen the banquet was over, and the servants were sent away, Xingqiu would take his coat off, revealing his dust and dirt-stained inner garments.\n\"Phew... That was a close one. Good thing this was in the cabinet. There was no way I was fooling my brother otherwise...\"\nPerhaps his next novel could be about a chivalrous thief from Fontaine, then?\n\"Hmm... Let's start with this: All know the common wisdom that damasked dress makes a deficient disguise, but none realized that celebrity was the cloak of this chivalrous thief...\"",

The primary color is that of luxurious cream, embroidered with intricate patterns.\nThe dark brown of the hat, gloves, and skirts have a rich chocolate-like texture. The fiery red that belongs only to Klee is like a crown of candles, shining with flame incandescent.\nThe tiny little Spark Knight, after an adventure in which even the clouds and trees could not help but dote upon her, has transformed with a flourish into the new \"Red Velvet Mage.\"\n\n\"To a mage, what is the most important thing?\"\nAfter returning to Mondstadt, two knights, one large and one small, are sitting on the city wall, watching the windmills lazily turn as they chat...\nThough Klee had heard the title \"mage\" before, but after hearing the stories of that fiery mage, the word slowly gained its own special significance to her.\nShe remembered that adults often spoke of important things linked to one's identity... perhaps they are called \"responsibilities\"?\nThe Dagger Bandit grinned mysteriously, and shook the wine bottle in his hand:\n\"A mage is called a mage because they can use that mystifying force called magic.\"\n\"The most important thing for a mage is to think about how to use the awesome power of their magic.\"\n\"The fiery red mage from all those years ago used her magic to fulfill the wishes of others, and created this refreshing paradise in the desert. The people sing her praises, and write her into their happiest stories, and she is a source of happiness and laughter.\"\n\"Perhaps, somewhere in the world, there are capricious mages with fearful tempers, or those who have been changed by terrible tragedy. Those mages may use their magic in the wrong ways, and make the people as angry and sad as they are...\"\n\"Red Velvet Mage Klee, how do you plan to use your magic?\"\nWith these words, the Dagger Bandit raised his glass to softly toast the tiny mage, indicating it was now her turn to answer her own question.\nThe Red Velvet Mage shook her head softly, and the juice in her cup reflected her pure smile:\n\"Klee... wants to make everyone really happy!\"\nBut with these words, the mage suddenly realized the problem with this desire—\nThose who are unhappy surely have their reasons for being sad. Would a smile forced upon their lips through magic be even more painful and ugly than tears?\nFortunately, her little mind worked quickly, and she soon found her answer:\nThen I'll use my magic to get rid of everyone's troubles!\n\"For example, magic could make everyone never get sick again, and never have to worry about Mora! Everyone could eat fish for every meal, and be healthy, and just happily play all day!\"\nBut that didn't seem like enough. Klee rested her cheek in her hand, and looked out over the azure sky and white clouds in the distance:\n\"I want... I want to hear everyone's wishes, and save them, and then use the most amazing and powerful magic, to give everyone the happiness they want the very very most!\"\nA smile is most beautiful when it is born of happiness. The reflective waters of Cider Lake taught Klee this truth.\nThe Dagger Bandit was stunned for a moment, but as the west wind caressed them, it turned into a feeling of peace and relief:\n\"In that case, our little Klee is going to have to try her best, isn't she? Perhaps some day, you and your magic will appear in the happiest and most joyous of all stories.\"\nIn the story, the Red Velvet Mage travels to every corner of Teyvat with her companions. Wherever they go, both troubles and bad guys recede, and poverty and suffering evaporate without a trace. Clusters of sweet flowers bloom, and are surrounded by the light of a roaring campfire, candles, and stars. The sounds of joyous song and jubilant dancing fill the air, a merry feast that never ends.",

      "lore": "\"All children love toys.\" This was the conclusion Shenhe came to after observing Granny Shan's toy store.\nKites, Xiao Lanterns, and window decorations made from cut colored paper... Children in Liyue could not help but stare fixedly at them as they passed.\nAnd should the adults beside them cotton on to their desire and buy that toy for them, those children would smile.\nShenhe possessed no such childhood memories of the sort, so she could not understand their feelings in that moment from experience. But seeing how their eyes sparkled, she believed that these toys must be related to some wondrous emotion.\nThough she had not figured out just what this emotion might be, this beautiful possibility did soften her heart a little.\n\n\"Shenhe seems very interested in toys.\" This was the conclusion Xianyun came to from observing Shenhe gazing at the toy store as if in a daze.\nHer disciple, she knew, had lost her family when young, and had trained under her wing ever since, and thus opportunities to access toys had been few and far between.\nNow that Shenhe had returned to live amongst humans, and she herself had taken their form to do so, she found as she grew more accustomed to the lives of mortals that Shenhe had indeed lacked many opportunities for joy compared to human children.\nAnd was it not her responsibility as master and elder, she thought, to accompany her disciple for a jaunt at the toy store?\n\n\n\"Master seems very fond of toys,\" Shenhe reflected as she and her master Xianyun, at the latter's insistence, spoke to Granny Shan for the sixth time.\nIn truth, she did not quite understand the charm of these little window decorations or firecrackers.\nHer master would often use sigils to create various colorful birds to decorate her abode. They were more vivid and lifelike than these decorations, and lovelier by far. And as for the crackling and popping of the firecrackers, they were quite crude compared to the adeptal melodies she was used to.\nIn truth, the toys themselves had but limited appeal to her, for what she actually liked was the smiles on the children's faces as they looked upon them.\nBut her master seemed very interested indeed, asking about all manner of details regarding the toys, from the crafting methods to the tricks behind releasing firecrackers. Finally, her master asked her what sort of toys she liked.\nShe believed that her master's interest must have some meaning behind it, and so she answered honestly. Then, she looked upon her master's calm, thoughtful, but silent face.\n\n\"Shenhe does not, in fact, like toys,\" Xianyun realized at last, after several visits to the toy stores.\nIf not, that gentle expression she saw on Shenhe's face as she stood in front of the toy store should have appeared at least once as she spoke with Granny Shan at length about the little imperfections in the latter's use of paper in window decorations, about improvements to firecracker casings to improve child safety, to the point she had completely earned the old lady's admiration.\nWhat her disciple needed was perhaps not toys themselves.\nA human's childhood and youth pass by in but the blink of an eye, and those who pass on shall never return. What, then, should she do as an elder?\nLantern Rite was fast approaching, and human custom dictated that festivals were a good opportunity to accept gifts. After all, had she not accepted just such from the Qixing in years prior...?\nA gift... Yes, that might do.\n\n\nShenhe did not realize her master's intent until she and Ganyu had received their Lantern Rite gifts from her.\nShe had felt no sense of regret about standing in front of the toy store, but her master's kindness was surprising all the same.\nIt was at that moment, when she took the long dress from the gift box her master handed to her and caressed its smooth hem that she understood how those children felt upon seeing those toys.\nBoth she and her master had changed much upon coming to the mortal realm — perhaps the future held still more pleasant surprises of this sort.\nHer future would be full of opportunities to make up for all the laughter lost and joy she had missed out on in the past. She would keep all the warmth she received in her heart, to melt the ice within her bones.",

The story behind it is also rather fascinating—\nSince her first day as the Yuheng, she has never enjoyed its privileges but has instead devoted much private time to her duty. To improve work efficiency, Keqing prefers a dressing style that prioritizes practicality and only keeps a minimum level of embellishment. Therefore, though like a flower she blooms, she used to dress simple.\nHowever, working closely with Ganyu and then Ningguang has given Keqing a sort of epiphany—\nKeqing accepts that she cannot work day and night like the half-adeptal secretary Ganyu. She also knows Ningguang's way well, who often takes a bath after work to withdraw from the moment. By temporarily putting the crazy agenda aside for the next day, Ningguang thus allows herself to fully relax.\nKeqing understands that to lead the tide of change requires not impatient leaps and bounds but care for one's body and mind. Good maintenance keeps one going smoothly.\nNingguang also gave Keqing similar advice:\n\"You've never donned anything special for festivals, and people are used to your image as it is. But Liyue is different now. If you show up in front of the public in a new look, it will add to the merrymaking and inspire everyone greatly.\"\nKeqing was aware of that, but she just wanted to transform silently so that she wouldn't worry her colleagues.\nHer attire for the Lantern Rite would serve as a good start.\n\"This attire marks the line between my work and life. By striking a balance between the two, I will find a comfortable pace at which I shall lead the way into a new Liyue.\"\nHaving made up her mind, Keqing had Ningguang's personal tailor make her a dress that still keeps luxury to a minimum. With the attire finished, Keqing threw herself back into the preparations for the Lantern Rite.\nAs for how she ended up overworking herself again, accidents like that do happen, occasionally.\nWhile conversing with the Traveler again in the Jade Chamber, their caring advice reminded Keqing of the decision she had made not long ago. A faint smile formed on her face.\nPerhaps this is what they call the tacit understanding between ideal companions, who are always on the same page.\nShe put on the long-readied attire and spoke gently to the Traveler, who looked her way. Having received generous praises, she turned to the blooming fireworks.\nThe light of festive fireworks set her dress aglow like a star in a dark night.

Even the carefree Knight of Boreas, Varka, praised him, calling him \"the pride of the Knights.\"\nThis was a matter of great comfort to his father, Crepus, who hoped that Diluc would be more successful than him. Not only would he bring dawn to Mondstadt as a member of the Ragnvindr Clan, but he would also become an excellent Knight of Favonius, standing at the apex of the crowd, inheriting and passing its noble traditions down.\nThis expectation would bleed into their conversations, into training, and into every little detail of life, with the proud father even having a ceremonial uniform tailored for Diluc well in advance.\nYet, for Diluc, his father's praises and his life as a knight were extinguished forever on that gloomy, rainy night, and the ceremonial garment thus lost its purpose.\nMany years later, the tragedy and the uproar had finally stabilized. Returning home, Diluc began his journey of \"reckoning.\"\nThis was not merely for his father's sake, but also on account of the convictions he had suffered much to gain. He would protect Mondstadt in his own way.\nThe ceremonial uniform of yesteryear was modified to serve as new cladding for battle. The fabric itself was familiar yet had the feeling of long-separation, and Diluc privately treasured it.\n\"That's my boy.\" Looking upon the gem around the neck that reflected his red hair, he recalled his father saying that.\nOn silent nights, the edge hidden under the velvet glove of the noble princeling will be unsheathed to counter any threat. And wherever the blade passed, wherever the claymore's arc flashed, raging flames would arise and burn the hidden nests of villainy to the ground.\nBy the time the name of the Darknight Hero had become well known to the people of Mondstadt, the red so striking that it might sear the eyes had long become a thing of awe and terror to monsters and crooks alike.\n\"The true dawn has yet to come.\"\nContrary to his father's expectations, Diluc knew that he must instead be a \"forerunner.\"",

Many days have already passed since they played the roles of bandit and mage on the stage, and even now, the small knight has questions about that which she does not yet understand.\n\n*Ahem* The reason the bandits carries daggers… The reason was never explained in Kaeya’s script. Perhaps it’s because the character needed a catchy name, and the director just excitedly scrawled the words, \"the Dagger Bandit.\" But the small knight in front of him sat with furrowed brow, deep in thought, more serious even than when thinking about what was for dinner.\n\nThe boundless curiosity of children makes them always want to ask questions. Even if the endless stream of questions can be a bit annoying for adults, if their curiosity is not satisfied, they may lose that spark of curiosity, and turn into a boring adult. Of all the infinite possibilities in life, becoming boring is one of the worst and most tragic outcomes, so a child’s questions should always be treated with care.\n\n\"Hey, that’s right, why is that? You asked a great question, Klee…\" Kaeya replied with a smile.\n\nPerhaps because he was briefly a bandit on that stage, he too had thought about lives lived that were not his own beneath the bright lights. Knights live as knights do, and bandits live as bandits must. Justly taking up sword and bow and standing forth to show their determination to protect, that is a knight. But hiding one’s blade and closing the net on their prey in the darkness, that is a bandit. Different people live in different ways. A thief will not bear the blade of a knight, and a traditional knight will not sneak out a hidden dagger to hurt someone.\n\nIf the characters in the story don’t abide by such rules, then the story has betrayed the roles dictated by fate. But there is no need to give such answers to a child, and there is never just one answer to a question. The daggers used by the Dagger Bandit were gifts from his friends, or symbols of his career as a virtuous bandit, or commemorated past acts of charity…\n\nLet’s fabricate a fairytale, and weave heroes, legends, and beautiful fantasies together, just like each time before, and give children a dream to dream. He turns around and takes the dagger from the side of the costume hanging in the room:\n\n\"It’s actually a complicated tale, and we’ll have to start from when the big bandit was just a little kid. Would you like to hear about it, Klee?\"\n\n\"Are you going to tell me another story, Kaeya? I’m listening!\"",

As such, I wanted to ask you for some recommendations.\"\nBefore you realized it, moved as you were by her words, Ayaka had already begun touching upon the particulars of her plan.\nAfter a moment of deep reflection, you put words to paper and fill the first line of the list in.\n\"'The Boar Princess'?\"\n\"Indeed,\" you reply. \"It's a beautiful and cruel fairy tale — rather different from other works of its kind. I think people will find it very interesting.\"\nUnfortunately, when Ayaka brought the list of books to Aratani, the editor crossed out \"The Boar Princess\" without hesitation.\n\"Ahem.

Naturally, she has little mind to spare for matters of personal dress, to say nothing of accessories or makeup.\nOver time, her everyday appearance and the word \"busy\" have become tightly bound. Even when she is spotted on her brief days off, one cannot help but worriedly picture her doing overtime till she practically falls asleep standing up, or wonder if she might suddenly do an about-face and make a beeline to take care of the nearest article of urgent business.\nXianyun saw all this, of course, and had long been considering countermeasures. Just as well, then, that Lantern Rite was imminent, and a suggestion that she had heard on the streets came to mind:\n\"A change of clothes may make for a change of mood...\"\nThus did the adeptus retrieve a machine she had sealed in storage for many years. Using it, some of her friend Ping's best Silk Flowers, and the dyes made using divine herbs from her abode, she weaved several bolts of fabric and satin of immaculate quality and color. As for the exquisite hair ornaments and pendants, they were made of the same material as her adeptal machines. Elegant, lovely, and infused with faint fragrance.\nThen, Xianyun brought the fabric and satin to one of the finest tailors in Liyue Harbor, though she did give the poor artisan quite a fright — after all, any ordinary valuation would appraise these materials at a price point somewhere around \"couldn't get more expensive if you'd just melted Mora down and spun it into silk.\"\nXianyun was pleased indeed with that reaction.\n\"One's disciple has worked many years at Yuehai Pavilion — a figure of standing and repute, surely, and more than worthy of such finery!\"\nOf course, Xianyun did not mention the unique aspects of the fabric or the accessories when she gave Ganyu this gift, mentioning only that the tailor's craftmanship had satisfied her.\nNonetheless, Ganyu could intuit the value of the raiment and the thought her master put into its impeccable artisanry from how the garment seemed to flow like water in her hands.\nAnd so she changed out of her usual working clothes and came out, light of heart, to meet the adeptus and her gathered friends, and at that moment her mood did quietly change—\nAs the clear starry night sky, as a tranquil scene of fragrant blossoms.\n\"Putting duty aside to spend a carefree Lantern Rite with everyone...
