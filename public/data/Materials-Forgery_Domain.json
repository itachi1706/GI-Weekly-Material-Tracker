Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.\nFew among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams.

This may explain the sage's eventual disillusionment and withdrawal from history.\nNotably, it was precisely during the reign of the Sacred Lord of the ineffable city that the practice of offering live sacrifices was banned outright.
